### ARCHIVE NOTE

This repo has been archived. I originally created this to learn about daemons and basic python.

The project is not finished, nor is it especially useful as it tries to replace the functionality
of the very well battle tested [cron(8)][cron-manpage]

However, feel free to do whatever you like with the code.

# Alarmed

The alarmed daemon.

Lightweight package for keeping track of alarms that run custom commands when they go off.

[cron-manpage]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html
